# Credit and Fair Use

The code inside the R directory is taken directly from the Shiny [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) as of Tuesday, July 7, 2020. All credit for the bulk of the code should be credited to the Shiny framework developers. Specific instances of edits to suit the purposes of COVIDMINDER (specifically ADA compliance will be annotated as such, with the author listed beside the changes.) Please review shiny's licensing document for further information on commercial use, fair use, and other legal matters.

# Content

A bulk of the shiny code has been cloned due to the dependent internal scripts being called by relevant code changes. The only needed code are the updated renderPlot and selectInput functions, and over time we will continue to trim uneeded repeat code as possible. In the long run, an ideal solution is to fork and push the changes to shinys official repository, specifically the alt text addition.
